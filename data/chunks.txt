features. 
My Tech Contributions 
My responsibilities included developing APIs, debugging, and enhancing backend 
logic. I used Node.js with AWS services like Lambda and DynamoDB. I tested APIs 
using Postman, used Serverless Framework for deployment, and managed code 
using Git and GitHub. 
Console Log Centralization & AWS Cost Optimization 
To optimize AWS CloudWatch costs, I created a centralized console utility function.

This utility accepted unlimited inputs and an 8-bit binary flag, like 11100000, where 
each bit controlled log levels – like log, warn, and error. By disabling logs in 
production, we minimized redundant logging and saved AWS costs.

management.
